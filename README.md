![Build Status](https://github.com/FBernuy/pytest-github-action/workflows/Run%20Tests/badge.svg)

Example of a Pytest run using github actions


## What is this?
This is a very basic actions usage: run pytest on pull requests

In this repo you will find two tests for a very basic code, and the `yml` code that the defines the action

## Does it work?
So far, yes (look at the badge!). Take a look at the pull requests and you will find the action summary with a green ticket :D

## Why does this exists?
Because I need some sandbox to try it before using it on another repo, so here it is :)

## Licence?
MIT License

## There is a BUG!
Make an issue with it so I can fix it some day!
