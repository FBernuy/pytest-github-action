Example of a Python code using github actions for testing and docker build


## What is this?
This is a very basic actions usage: run pytest on pull requests and docker build

In this repo you will find two tests for a very basic code, and the `yml` file that the defines the test action, and a second `yml` file that defines the docker build action

## Does it work?
So far, yes (look at the badges!). Take a look at the pull requests and you will find the action summary with a green ticket or red ticket when it fails

## Why does this exists?
Because I needed some sandbox to try it before using it on another repo, so here it is :)

## Licence?
MIT License

## There is a BUG!
Make an issue with it so I can fix it *soon**!
